                        The dataset consisted of 26 folders(A-Z) containing handwritten images in size 28x28 pixels, and each image is a gray-scale image. Autoencoders were implemented in 2 ways
                        first via Dense NN and later via CNN(Encoding and Decoding), and was  evaluated based on how perfeclty the input data is reconstructed.
